          My background is in building secure distributed systems&mdash;from
          bare metal racked up in a data center running Linux, Windows, and
          FreeBSD to cloud platforms that securely connect vehicles, ships, and
          airplanes owned by the United States Government.

          At Fix Security, I spend my time on Zoom calls with our users and turn
          their needs and feedback into new product capabilities. I built our
          original open source asset inventory and security graph that&rsquo;s
          now the foundation for Fix Security. The cloud is a graph, not a
          table&mdash;and security tooling should reflect that. I&rsquo;m also

          I started with economics and statistics, but then found networks and
          computers much more interesting. At my last two companies, we built
          observability products for microservices, Kubernetes, data pipelines,
          and cloud warehouses.

          At Fix Security, I&rsquo;m usually the first line of support for
          customers. I ask a lot of questions about your existing security stack
          and the compliance frameworks you need to track. Since I come from the
          cloud warehouse space and analytics engineering, I look at security
          data as just another data source that needs to be centralized and
          visualized in a dashboard.

          Before Fix Security, I was an Apache committer and the technical lead
          for Marathon, a highly available cluster scheduler for container
          orchestration for Apache Mesos. I also built the trip execution and
          vehicle dispatching system for MOIA, Volkswagen&rsquo;s ride pooling
          service.
        </p>
        <p>
          I lead a team of engineers in creating the building blocks of Fix
          Security. This includes developing a search syntax that enables
          intuitive searching and traversing of our security graph without the
          hassle of a learning a complex graph query language. I also ensure
          that our unified data model works across all cloud resources Fix
          Security supports.

            We think modern cloud security combines the best of data collection,
            anomaly detection, and presentation of insights in a way that is
            actionable and understandable by a human.
